### Introduction-to-Computer-Science-II
(**Note**: internally referred to as CS2 in many locations)  
(**Also Note**: possibly occasionally referred to as CS162, since I made these materials originally for use in Oregon, where many of us in community college and university settings have used a common course numbering system for many years through a voluntary group of CS chairs or their representatives with the Orgeon Council of Computer Chairs (OCCC, [https://occcwiki.org/](https://occcwiki.org/)))  
  
**Description**: An OER version of the collection of CS2 materials that I have created over the years, compiled on GH starting 2024-03-09.
