### Introduction-to-Computer-Science-II  

&ensp;&ensp;(**Note**: internally referred to as CS2 in many locations)  

&ensp;&ensp;(**Also Note**: possibly occasionally referred to as CS162, since I made these materials originally for use in Oregon, where many of us in community college and university settings have used a [common course numbering system](https://occcwiki.org/courses/common_numbers.html) for many years through a voluntary group of CS chairs or their representatives with the Orgeon Council of Computer Chairs (OCCC, [https://occcwiki.org/](https://occcwiki.org/))) discussing and promoting to our respective curriculum committees that we should have agreement where possible for ease of transfer and clarity to students about what our courses cover and how they transfer to other institutions.
